# Pk_Pipeline_Development

This repo contains development and exploratory scripts for our variant calling pipeline that is being designed to investigate the novel Plasmodium Knowlesi parasite. The workflow is summarised in the Rmd Workflow.Rmd. 

Other repo's will contain study-speciifc workflows using the pipeline developed here, and may be more intuitive for those who wish to replicate the workflow.
